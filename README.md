# Setting up Qt Creator Using WSL2 on Windows 11

Last Updated: 4/4/2025

Recently I've been messing around with Qt Creator trying to develop applications for personal usage, but I've struggled a bit with setting up the framework itself.

If you're reading this, you're probably encountering some issues as well, so hopefully this guide helps out a bit (even if it might not be perfect).

Here's a table of contents that I'll be going through:

- [Downloading and setting up Qt Creator](#downloading-and-setting-up-qt-creator)
- [Getting the terminal to work with WSL2](#getting-the-terminal-to-work-with-wsl2)
- [Compiling, running, and releasing a program](#compiling,-running,-and-releasing-a-program)

Ok, lets get started...

## Downloading and Setting up Qt Creator
When you first visit the Qt Creator website, you might wonder where to go to download the framwork itself.
Lucky for you, heres a direct link to the installer downloads for each platform: [https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss).
There's a lot of info about licensing with (L)GPLv3 which is worth reading, but it mostly revolves around open source usage (I think).

Once you've downloaded the installer for Windows, simply follow through the installer steps to download Qt Creator.

On the screen that asks for installation options, click on ```Qt [version] for desktop development``` and continue the insallation as normal.

Once Qt Creator has finished installing, we can move on to the next step!

## Getting the Terminal to Work With WSL2
More coming soon!!! I will actually finish this guide unless A. my pc blows up or B. i realize that you can't actually use wsl2 and qt creator for some reason.
